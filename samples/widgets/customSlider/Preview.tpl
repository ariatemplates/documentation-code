		Aria Templates comes with integrated widgets which can be used directly.
		However, if you need widgets which are not provided in the default library, it is possible for you to develop your own custom widgets, and to gather them in a new custom widget library.
		This page shows an example of a basic slider widget which is not in the default aria library, and which uses the following features of the Aria Templates framework: a CSS template, event delegation and listeners on the data model.
